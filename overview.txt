An image classification program that uses Google's Machine Learning library, Tensorflow and a pre-trained Deep Learning Convolutional Neural Network model called Inception. This repository classifies four image data sets - 2D-line, 2D-Pie, 2D-Bar, 3D-Plots and returns a prediction score denoting the possibility of it being in a particular class.
